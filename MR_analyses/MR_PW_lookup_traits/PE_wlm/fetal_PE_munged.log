Interpreting column names as follows:
Allele2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
MarkerName:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
Allele1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
P-value:	p-Value
Effect:	[linear/logistic] regression coefficient (0 --> no effect; above 0 --> A1 is trait/risk increasing)

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from /gpfs/mrc0/projects/Research_Project-MRC158833/rnb203/programs/ldscores/w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from fetal_preeclampsia_filtered.gz into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 10400841 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 9203454 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
