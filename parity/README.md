## Parity

Analysis of the link between the top SNPs and parity in independent samples of the [Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa)](https://www.fhi.no/en/ch/studies/moba/).

- [Extraction of genotypes](parity.snake): Extraction of the genotypes for the lead SNPs
- [Linear model script](linear_model.R): Script used to run linear models
- [Forest plots script](forest_plots.R): Script used to run make forest plots
- [Summary statistics](lm): Summary statistics for the analyses with parity
- [Plots](plots): P-value, QQ, and forest plots for the different estimates
